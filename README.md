### Gesture Recognition System

This Java program demonstrates a simple Gesture Recognition System. It prompts the user to perform a gesture, recognizes the gesture based on predefined rules, and outputs the corresponding action.

### How it works:

1. The program prompts the user to perform a gesture.
2. It recognizes the gesture based on predefined rules using the `recognizeGesture` method.
3. The recognized action is displayed to the user.

### Usage:

1. Compile the `GestureRecognitionSystem.java` file.
2. Run the compiled program.
3. Follow the instructions to perform a gesture.

### Example:

```
Please perform a gesture (e.g., wave hand, make a fist):
wave hand
Recognized action: Wave detected. Opening door.

```
